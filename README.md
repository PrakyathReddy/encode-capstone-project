# APARTMENT DAO

Apartment DAO

Let’s say there’s a large gated community with over 1000 apartments. There are maintenance issues every now and then, such as fixing broken pipes, elevators not working, garbage collection issues, etc. How do we address these issues?

**Current system**: Choose a representative to identify issues and resolve them. Maintain a corpus fund to pay for repair works. 

**Issues with the current system**: An apartment rep that’s lazy, corrupted or incapable. May steal funds from the treasury by quoting extra amounts for repair works. No track for how the corpus fund is being utilized. Lack of transparency. Not prioritising issues based on merit, like only resolving issues that concern the president or his close friends. 

**Our solution**: A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to vote on issues and resolve them in a transparent manner. There will not be a common representative, but instead a committee of members responsible for executing tasks. 

As a resident, person A notices a broken tube light on the 5th floor. There’s an account on our Solana DAO called ‘list_of_issues’. Person A describes the issue he just witnessed and appends it to this list. 

Each issue in this ‘list_of_issues’ has a certain priority based on the impact it has. This priority is decided in a similar way to what you see on Stack Overflow with Upvotes. Let’s say this broken light impacts residents of 5 apartments on that floor. So this issue now gets 5 Upvotes. 

On an advanced level, we can decide the priority of an issue based on Stephen Covey’s Time Management Matrix. 

Similarly, there will be multiple issues with different degrees of impact. Something like a broken elevator could impact 100 residents and so have 100 Upvotes. 

The list keeps re-arranging in descending order of upvotes for an issue, determining its priority.

Coming to the apartments, each unit will be unique as an NFT, and each NFT will have certain privileges, which would prevent non-residents from voting. On an advanced level, we can create an auction for each NFT (apartment) open to the outside world, and let them bid on it. Existing NFT can be sold and ownership updated accordingly. There will be an account that holds a list of addresses (of NFT) that have voting privileges.

We will have another account called ‘corpus_fund’ where each resident will contribute Lamports. 

There are 3 possible states for each issue - ‘InQueue’, ‘WIP’ & ‘Resolved’

The issue with top priority (highest upvotes) changes its status from ‘InQueue’ to ‘WIP’ (Work In Progress). Once approved (or certain conditions are met), the budget is estimated and funds are automatically transferred to an appropriate account, who in real life, is responsible for resolving the issue. Once the issue has been resolved, it will be documented, added to the description of this issue and then its status changed from ‘WIP’ to ‘Resolved’.
